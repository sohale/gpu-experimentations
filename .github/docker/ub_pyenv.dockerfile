# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4
# ^ Don't change

# todo: used this in .github/workflows/ci_asic_19.yaml
# Not tested.
# Also useful for development, like GitPod. (not just GH Actions CI workflows)

# Naming: decision for places:
#    .github/docker/ub_pyenv.dockerfile
#    .github/docker/pyenv-image/Dockerfile
#    provisioning_scripts/cicd/ub_pyenv.dockerfile

# Dev Notes:

# todo: ARG, ENV, LABEL

#
#     * ENV
#         * ENV is only runtime, not available at build time.
#         * i.e. during execution "run" of Docker image
#         * Readable in run (executable) time & build time too? (!contradiciton).
#         * ENV persists in the final image too. (via metadata? todo: check)
#         * ENV is set (being assgned to) (evaluated) at build time
#         * You cannot set it programmatically:
#               Cannot: `ENV COMMIT_HASH="$(cat ./sosi_commit_hash_local.txt)"` or `BUILD_FINISH_DATE=$(date)`
#               Because you cannot "RUN" things in an "ENV".
#         * Can inherit from the base/parent image, e.g. for the ${x:-$y} pattern (todo: check).
#
#     * ARG:
#         * ARG is only build time, not available at runtime.
#         * ARG not preserved in the final image.
#         * ARG accesses as: ${argname}, or $argname, or ${x:-$y}
#                e.g. in RUN commands, and in ENV. (expended in the cli commands in RUN)
#                can be used to parametrise ENV, LABEL.
#                and RUN.
#         * Hence, ARG can clash with ENV variables, if they have the same name (? check).
#         * ARG also can be used in LABEL values (to parametrise them)
#         * ARG is set (being assgned to) (evaluated) at build time, not at runtime.
#         * Not sure: you can ENV newenvname=${envname:-$argname}
#
#     * LABEL:
#         * Standard dockerhub labels. metadata, only in Docker image, for informational & organizational purposes only.
#         * Unlike ARG, cannot be read!
#         * cannot be read in RUN, nor in ENV!
#         * There are some standard dockerhub labels: `maintainer`, `description`.

# Order of USER,  RUN, ENV, etc matters. Even ENV can be changed between RUN steps (see DEBIAN_FRONTEND).

# To enable BuildKit: (Docker BuildKitâ€™s extended syntax)
# First line should start with: # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.3
#      Necessary for new syntax suh as ARGs to be used in FROM
# Must build using:
#          DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --ssh default ...
#
#         --ssh default
#         { "features": { "buildkit": true } }

# Also enable `--ssh default`: (why? Maybe: "for SSH keys, e.g. for git clone private repos")


# GH Actions CI workflow build(x):
#   See usage of "docker/setup-buildx-action@v3" in workflow

# Local machine build:
#
# I don't want "cache busting", which is to save space.
# Instead, I may want to disable it, to save build time: by reusing built layers that haven't changed.
# To manually clean / prune the cache:
#    docker builder prune --all --force

# Instructions to install buildx on your local machine::
#{
#   # ./helpers/install_docker_buildx.bash
#   mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins;
#   BUILD_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/docker/buildx/releases/latest | grep '"tag_name"' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
#   echo "BUILD_VERSION: ${BUILD_VERSION}"
#   curl -Lo ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx "https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/download/${BUILD_VERSION}/buildx-${BUILD_VERSION}.linux-amd64"
#   chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
#   docker buildx version
#}
#
# To make sure buildx is installed
#    docker buildx version
# To actually build:
#    docker buildx build ./ub_pyenv.dockerfile

# To learn: build vs bake. (in context of "buildx")
# To learn:
#     DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build ...
#         vs
#     docker buildx ...
#         vs
#     DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --ssh default ...

# In a buildx system:
# (remote) registry
# local images registry and local daemon
# local context directory
# local builder instances
# local builder instance (used for build)

# The driver for a "buildx-build": "--driver docker-container" vs "--driver docker" (default)
# The `--use` = current chosen (a bit like `cd` or `chroot`).
# The current (`--use`) driver can be non-buildx (unsure, check).
# You can have multiple "BUILDKIT" versions instantiated!
# A local builder instance has a "name" (via `--name`)

# More on builder:
#  "builder instance"s, configured builder instance.

#      docker buildx build \
